# imagePredictions

The goal of this project is to predict "popularity" of landscape images using features that I calculate from images. 

The images are from reddit.com/earthporn, and are obtained using the ripme tool (https://github.com/4pr0n/ripme). Popularity is measured by votes.

Data is likely too noisy for accurate measurements (and score is affected by too many variables) so I'm working on predicting whether an image is over or under a threshold value.
